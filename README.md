## About Marble Machine

The core mechanics of this client-side JavaScript app was built in 24 hours using JavaScript and React. The React component rendering process is tightly controlled and maximally optimized for minimal rerendering and reconciliation.

Marble Machine has been inspired by [Wintergatan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q). As a musician myself (violin, piano, orchestra conducting, guitar, and bass) with prior experience in creating looped electronic/acoustic music, I set out to combine my passion for programming and my love for music in one app.

* Does not work in Firefox due to the way Firefox handles (or rather, is unable to handle) a large number of concurrent audio files
