## About Marble Machine

The core mechanics of this client-side JavaScript app was built in 24 hours using JavaScript and React. The React component rendering process is tightly controlled and 100% optimized for minimal rerendering and reconciliation.

Marble Machine has been inspired by [Wintergatan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q). As a musician myself (violin, piano, orchestra conducting, guitar, and bass) with prior experience in creating looped electronic/acoustic music, I set out to combine my passion for programming and my love for music in one app.

#### Known Compatability Issues

* Does not work in Firefox due to the way Firefox handles (or rather, is unable to handle) a large number of concurrent audio files
* Does not work with most Bluetooth audio devices for the same reason given above
